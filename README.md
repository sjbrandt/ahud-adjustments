# ahud adjustments
This is an ahud fork, meaning the project is copied from the [original ahud repo](https://github.com/n0kk/ahud), and then I have added changes that I want.

### Complete list of changes and their justifications in this fork:
- Vertically centered the "Play" button on the main menu
  - I thought it looked weird for the "Play" text to have its bottom aligned with the bottom of the TF logo to its left
  - In this version, the "Play" text is centrally aligned around the same axis as the TF logo
- Fixed MVM currency label being invisible
  - In the official ahud, the mvm currency label is stuffed into the top left corner and only about 1/8th if it is visible
  - In this version, the currency label is whole and is placed above the player's health

Below is the readme from the original ahud project by [n0kk](https://github.com/n0kk).

I have tested ahud on my Windows PC using a 16:9 monitor primarily on resolutions 1280x720 and above. ahud works on 16:10 and 4:3 and I'll be providing support for these aspect ratios as best as I can. Unfortunately, no Mac or Linux support.
